# 309-Final-Project
We made a Connect Four game using C++ that allows a user to play against another user, a computer, or watch two computer players compete against one another.

This game models the classic version of the board game, Connect 4. 
Connect 4 is a two player game where the object of the game is to connect 4 tokens (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
The game uses a standing board that commonly has 6 rows and 7 columns.
Players take turns dropping their token (red or yellow) into the top of the board.

Changes:
Our adaptation of Connect 4 follows all of the classic board game rules, and uses the 6 by 7 board.

How to: There are no software or system dependencies required to run this code. Just download and run. 


Features:
Computer Players
The computer players are unintelligent and move randomly. 

Different Playing Modes
The user has options to do 3 different types of play mode: Computer vs Computer, Player vs Computer, and Player vs Player.

Board Display
Due to limited visuals, the board prints letters rather than numbers.

Check Win
Unlike the virtual board game, the program will check the winner for the user for each turn.

Status:
Everything is working properly.
