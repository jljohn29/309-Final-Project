# 309-Final-Project
We made a Connect Four game using C++ that allows a user to play against another user, a computer, or watch two computer players compete against one another.

This game models the classic version of the board game, Connect 4. 
Connect 4 is a two player game where the object of the game is to connect 4 tokens (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
The game uses a standing board that commonly has 6 rows and 7 columns.
Players take turns dropping their token (red or yellow) into the top of the board.

Changes:
Our adaptation of Connect 4 follows all of the classic board game rules, and uses the 6 by 7 board.

How to: No software of system dependencies are needed in order to run this project. Just download the code and run it on any software that is C++ compatible.  


Features:

Computer Players:
The computer players are unintelligent and move randomly using a random number generator. 

Different Playing Modes:
The user has options to do 3 different types of play mode: Computer vs Computer, Player vs Computer, and Player vs Player.

Board Display:
Due to limited visuals, the board initializes as a 6x7 grid with dots in each space. With each move, the board prints a letter in the selected space to indicate that a token has been placed there.

Check Win:
Unlike the physical board game, the program will check the winner for the user after each turn.

Status:
Everything is working properly.
